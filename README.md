## fun fact: 
1. The world's largest order of French fries was placed in 2012 by a group of students in India. They ordered 10,942 kg (24,117 lbs) of French fries from McDonald's.

2. The longest French fry ever made was 1.8 km (1.1 miles) long and was created in the Netherlands in 2013. It took over 300 volunteers and 25 hours to make.

3. In the United States, French fries are the most popular side dish, with over 95% of people ordering them at fast food restaurants.

4. The first frozen French fry was invented by a man named Clarence Birdseye in 1929. He developed a process called "flash freezing" that allowed potatoes to be frozen quickly and without losing their texture or flavor.

5. In France, French fries are actually called "pommes frites" (French for "fried potatoes") to distinguish them from other types of potatoes that are boiled or mashed.

6. In some parts of the world, such as Australia and New Zealand, French fries are called "chips." This is likely due to the fact that they are cut into thin, chip-like shapes before being fried.

7. The world's first drive-thru restaurant, called "In-Go-Fort," opened in the United States in 1971 and served only burgers and French fries.

8. In 2016, a man in the United States set a world record for eating the most French fries in one minute. He consumed 45 French fries in just 60 seconds!
